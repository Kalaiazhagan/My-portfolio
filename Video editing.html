            Video editing is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a new work. It involves the selection and combining of shots into sequences, and ultimately creating a finished motion picture. It is an art form that allows editors to control the pace and rhythm of a story, often transforming raw footage into a compelling narrative. Modern video editing is done digitally, using software that offers a vast array of tools and effects to enhance the storytelling process. From cutting out unwanted parts, adding transitions, and inserting special effects to color correction and sound design, video editing is a crucial step in the production of films, television shows, and online content, shaping the final product that audiences will see.
